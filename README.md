# Search Google Maps Back

**Search Google Maps Back** is a user script that restores features recently removed by Google in Europe, such as the **"Open in Maps"** button and the ability to click on mini-maps in Google search results. With this script, you can enjoy the simplicity and seamless navigation between Google search results and Google Maps.

## üöÄ Features

- **Restore the "Open in Maps" button**: Brings back the "Open in Maps" button in the expanded map of Google search results, providing direct access to Google Maps.
- **Restore the "Maps" button in the list**: Adds back the "Maps" button near the "Images" button, etc.
- **Clickable mini-maps**: Makes the mini-maps displayed in Google search results interactive again, allowing you to click directly to Google Maps.

Enjoy a smoother and more intuitive search experience, just like it was before the recent changes.
